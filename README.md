# Sboiler
Simple boilerplate for rapid website design. 

No Javascript. 
No compiling/re-compiling CSS for custom themes.
Responsive design elements.
Dynamic elements such as carousels, tabbed views, visibility toggles, and more. 

All with pure CSS.

## Goal
Sboiler is an experiment meant to test the limits of what exactly can be done purely with CSS in a way that meets most of the basic needs of modern websites, and to do so with a minimal amount of readable/understandable code.

## Status - IN PROGRESS
Currently, Sboiler is incomplete.
