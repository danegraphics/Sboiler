# Sboiler
Simple boilerplate for rapid website design. 

- No Javascript!
- No compiling/re-compiling CSS for custom themes! Just include your custom CSS theme file!
- Responsive design elements!
- Dynamic elements such as carousels, tabbed views, visibility toggles, and more!
- **Classes for easy centering! (Just add "center" "center-v" or "center-h" to the element you want to center!)**

All with pure CSS. Just apply whatever classes you need and boom!

## Goal
Sboiler is an experiment meant to test the limits of what exactly can be done purely with CSS in a way that meets most of the basic needs of modern websites, and to do so with a minimal amount of code and with quickly readable code.

## Status - IN PROGRESS
Work on Sboiler has only just started, so most of the features that will be in the final design are currently missing. This also isn't an urgent project on my todo list, so it might be a while before this is actually finished.
